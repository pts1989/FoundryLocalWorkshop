🚀 Workshop: The Mars Colony "Offline" Ops Console

Duration: 2 Hours

Level: Intermediate

Prerequisites: Laptop with Admin Rights, VS Code, GitHub Account.

🪐 Mission Briefing

Year: 2042.

Location: Ares Prime Colony, Mars.

Status: CRITICAL.

A solar flare has knocked out the Deep Space Network. We have lost all connection to Azure Cloud on Earth. You are the Lead Systems Architect.

Your mission is to spin up a local AI "Mission Control" on your laptop (the colony's backup server) to manage life support and rover logistics. You cannot rely on the cloud. You must run everything locally.
